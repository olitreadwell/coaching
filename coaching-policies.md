# Online Tutoring Policies and Guidelines

<em>last updated 2023-07-23</em>

Hello there! We're absolutely thrilled to have you join our online tutoring community. Let's make learning fun and effective together! Here are some simple and friendly policies with all the details you need:

## 1. Cancellation Policy:
   - We understand that sometimes plans change, and that's okay! If you can't make it to a tutoring session, please give us a heads-up at least one day (24 hours) before the scheduled time. This way, we can reschedule or cancel without any charge.
   - If you need to cancel within 24 hours, don't worry! We'll do our best to be understanding, but there might be a small fee because our tutors set aside that time just for you.
   - Emergencies happen, and we promise to be understanding and considerate in those situations.
   - Regularly canceling sessions within the 24-hour notice period may affect our ability to reschedule or may lead to additional fees.

## 2. Be Respectful and Kind:
   - We believe in creating a friendly and positive learning environment where everyone feels comfortable.
   - Be patient and supportive with your fellow students and your tutor. We're all here to help each other grow.
   - Avoid any disrespectful behavior, such as name-calling, teasing, or making fun of others.
   - Listen to your tutor's instructions and ask questions politely if you need help understanding something.
   - If something is bothering you during a session, talk to your tutor openly about it, and they'll do their best to help.

## 3. No-Show Policy:
   - If you can't make it to a tutoring session, let us know as soon as you can or at least before the session starts.
   - If you miss a session without telling us, it's considered a "no-show."
   - Frequent no-shows may lead to us discussing the best way to move forward, so please communicate with us.

## 4. Tell Your Friends and Get Discounts!
   - We love making new friends through you! If you tell your friends about our tutoring, and they sign up with us, you'll get a discount on your next session.
   - When your friends join us, they'll also receive a special discount as a welcome gift from us.
   - Discounts for referrals are valid for both the existing student (that's you!) and the new student referred by you.
   - There's no limit to how many friends you can refer, so spread the word and enjoy the discounts!

## 5. Learn Together, Pay Less:
   - Learning with friends can be a lot of fun, and it's budget-friendly too! If you and your friends study together in a group, we offer special discounted rates.
   - Group rates are available for sessions with two or more students. So gather your study buddies and let's have a group learning session!
   - Group rates apply to each student in the session, making it an excellent way to learn while saving on tutoring costs.
   - If you prefer a one-on-one session later, you can switch back anytime.

## 6. Extra Learning Hours, Extra Savings:
   - We're super excited to see your enthusiasm for learning! If you book a tutoring session for more than 2 hours, we'll give you a special discount on the hourly rate.
   - Longer sessions allow us to dive deeper into topics and have more productive learning experiences.
   - Extended session discounts apply automatically when you book a session longer than 2 hours, so no extra steps required.

## 7. Need to Change the Time? No Worries!
   - Life can be unpredictable, and we totally understand that plans may change sometimes.
   - If you need to reschedule a session, please let us know at least one day (24 hours) before the scheduled time, so we can find another suitable time for you.
   - Rescheduling requests are subject to availability, but we'll do our best to accommodate your new preferred time.

## 8. Paying for Tutoring:
   - We've made the payment process super simple for you. You can pay for tutoring sessions securely using your credit card or through PayPal.
   - Before your first session, we'll guide you through the payment process step-by-step, so you'll have no trouble making the payment.

## 9. Get Ready for Fun Learning!
   - To join our online tutoring sessions, all you need is a computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access.
   - We'll use easy-to-use tools and apps to make learning interactive, engaging, and enjoyable.
   - Our tutor will walk you through the setup process before your first session, so you'll be all set to learn and have fun!

## 10. Your Privacy Matters:
  - We value your privacy, and we promise to keep all your personal information safe and secure.
  - We won't share your data with anyone outside our tutoring service without your permission.
  - If you have any concerns about your privacy or data security, feel free to talk to us about it. We're here to address any worries you may have.

## 11. Happy Learning Guarantee:
  - Our top priority is your happiness and success in your studies. If, for any reason, you're not totally happy with a tutoring session, please let us know.
  - We might offer you a free makeup session or consider other options to ensure you're satisfied with the tutoring experience.
  - Our aim is to support you and provide the best learning environment possible, and we'll do whatever we can to make it happen!
